# Student_grade_calculator

Project Requirements:

1. Implement a Java program with a class named `StudentGradeCalculator`.
2. Inside the `StudentGradeCalculator` class, create a method `String calculateGrade(int marks)` that takes an integer marks as input and returns the grade of the student based on the following criteria:
   - 90 and above: "A+"
   - 80 and above: "A"
   - 70 and above: "B"
   - 60 and above: "C"
   - 50 and above: "D"
   - Below 50: "F"

3. In the main method of the program:
   - Prompt the user to enter the student's marks.
   - Call the `calculateGrade` method to determine the grade based on the provided marks.
   - Display the calculated grade to the user.

4. Use appropriate user prompts and ensure that the program handles invalid inputs gracefully.
